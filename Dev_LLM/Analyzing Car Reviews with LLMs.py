'''Car-ing is sharing, an auto dealership company for car sales and rental, is taking their services to the next level thanks to Large Language Models (LLMs).

As their newly recruited AI and NLP developer, you've been asked to prototype a chatbot app with multiple functionalities that not only assist customers but also provide support to human agents in the company.

The solution should receive textual prompts and use a variety of pre-trained Hugging Face LLMs to respond to a series of tasks, e.g. classifying the sentiment in a carâ€™s text review, answering a customer question, summarizing or translating text, etc.
